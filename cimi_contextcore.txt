Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.clinicalcontextcore
Description:	"The Context Core Package defines the high-level clinical statement context classes. Three types of contexts are currently defined in CIMI: (1) Finding Contexts, (2) Action Contexts, and (3) Event Contexts. Finding contexts are used to specify whether a finding was observed to be present or absent. Action contexts are used to specify whether a clinical activity was performed, ordered, planned, or perhaps not performed."
Uses:			cimi.datatypes, cimi.foundation, cimi.core, cimi.clinicalassociation, cimi.clinicalentity, cimi.clinicalprovenance, cimi.clinicalevaluationresult, cimi.clinicalcommondatastructures

Element:		StatementContext
Based on:		VIRTUALCLUSTER
Concept:		TBD
Description: 	"Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that provides the context for the topic of a clinical statement. The StatementContext class aligns with the SNOMED CT Situations with Explicit Context. The StatementContext provides the expressivity required to specify that an act was performed or not performed or that a finding was asserted to be present or absent for the given subject of information. It also often holds provenance information relevant to the context of the clinical statement. It is important to note that by default the context applies to the conjunction of the attribute specified in the statement. For instance, if a clinical statement has a topic describing a rash on left arm and a context of 'absent', then the statement states that the subject of interest did not have a rash on the left arm but might have had one on the right arm."
1..1			ContextCode //Formerly Context
// BALLOT: ClinicalStatement.Context is given by a StatementContext. StatementContext also has a context, StatementContext.Context. The resulting path, ClinicalStatement.Context.Context, is quite confusing, especially since both contexts share virtually identical definitions. I suggest ClinicalStatement.Context.ContextCode would be much cleaner.
0..1			TemporalContext

Element:		ContextCode
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The ontological status of the statement, e.g., whether it exists, does not exist, is planned, etc. Attribute aligns with the SNOMED CT Situation with Explicit Context (SWEC) Concept Model context attributes: 'Finding context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408729009) and 'Procedure context (attribute)' (SCTID: 408730004). The range allowed for this attribute shall be consistent with the SNOMED CT concept model specification for SWEC."
Value:			CodedText

Element:		TemporalContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Whether the topic is prospective or retrospective. E.g., action occurred in the past. This attribute is aligned with the SNOMED Situation With Explicit Context temporal context attribute."
Value:			CodedText

Element:		FindingContext
Based on:		StatementContext
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The FindingContext class aligns with the SNOMED Situation with Explicit Context for findings and provides the context for the EvaluationResult and Assertion topics of a clinical statement. For instance, a statement about findings may state that the finding was observed present or absent."
0..1			CurrentStatus

Element:		CurrentStatus
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Current state of the evaluation (e.g., pending, complete, partial)."
Value:			CodedText
// BALLOT: The name "CurrentStatus" could cause confusion because if refers to the time the record was written. However, when the record is read, the CurrentStatus is really a PastStatus - namely, the status when the information was last updated. Suggest changing to "FindingStatus", which has no unintended implications of time.
// BALLOT: FindingContext.CurrentStatus has an inadequate defintion. What is the 'evaluation' whose state the CurrentStatus represents?

Element:		PresenceAbsenceContext

Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Base class for contexts asserting presence or absence of a finding."

Element:		Absent
Based on:		PresenceAbsenceContext

Element:		ActionContext
Based on:		StatementContext
Concept:		TBD
