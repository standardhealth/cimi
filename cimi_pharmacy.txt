Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.clinicalpharmacy
Description:	"The Pharmacy package contains classes related to the administration and dispense of medications. Pharmacy classes can be used to represent Medication Administration, Medication Statement, Medication Request, and Medication Dispense. They are derived from archetypes on the following clinical statements, topics, and contexts:
Medication Administration: ClinicalStatement<MedicationAct,(Non)Performance>
Medication Dispense: ClinicalStatement<MedicationAct,MedicationDispensePerformance>
Medication Request: ClinicalStatement<MedicationAct,MedicationOrder>
Medication Statement: ClinicalStatement<MedicationAct,(Non)Performance>"

'The total original number of refills. Outpatient only' - HL7 Version 2.8, RXE-12. 'An integer indicating the number of times, in addition to the original dispense, (aka refills or repeats) that the patient can receive the prescribed medication. Usage Notes: This integer does NOT include the original order dispense. This means that if an order indicates dispense 30 tablets plus '3 repeats', then the order can be dispensed a total of 4 times and the patient can receive a total of 120 tablets.' - HL7 FHIR, MedicationOrder.dispenseRequest.numberOfRepeatsAllowed 'Number of refills authorized by the prescriber.' - NCPDP Telecommunication (Field 415-DF, Data Dictionary 201104). Note that while the NCPDP Telecommunication structure treats this field as a code, it contains a number from 0-99, where zero means no refills authorized, and 1-98 are the number of refills authorized, and 99 means unlimited refills authorized."

0..1			Method
0..1			Dose
0..1			Rate
0..1			RateRatio
// Dosage is a class without a parent class. I can't think of another class in CIMI that doesn't somehow descend from LOCATABLE. I think this must be a mistake. Should the parent be CLUSTER?

Element:		DosageAsText
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"How the medication is&#47;was taken or should be taken"
Value:			PlainText

Element:		AdministrationBodySite
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Body site to administer to"
Value:			AnatomicalLocation

Element:		BodySiteCode
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Body site to administer to as a precoordinated code."
Value:			CodedText
// BALLOT: CIMI recognizes isosemantic forms, in particular, the Analysis Normal Form (ANF) and Clinical Entry Form (CEF). Are the classes in CIMI supposed to be one or the other, or are they supposed to be both simultaneously? I see cases (I'm looking at Dosage right now, but there are many others) where there is a specific spot for a pre-coordinated code (e.g., Dosage.BodySiteCode) and at the same time, there is a place for a post coordinated form (Dosage.BodySite which is an AnatomicalLocation with separate laterality, direction, etc.). If it is the intended design that the CIMI classes are "unions" of ANF and CEF forms, then how will we designate the portion of the structure that should be used for ANF, as opposed to the different portion of the structure that should be used for CEF? Are we going down a path that is going to require layering profiles on top of CIMI classes (one ANF profile, and one or more CEF profiles)? My recommendation is to create structures for ANF only. Transforms can do the rest.

Value:			Proportion // DELTA: changed Class<T> to Proportion
// BALLOT: Dosage.RateRatio is incorrect; should be datatype Proportion, not Class<T>

Element:		DosageEvent
Based on:		CLUSTER
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Pattern for the dosing of a medication. Describes the medication dosage information details e.g. dose, rate, site, route, etc."
// BALLOT: The class DosageEvent seems to be devoid of purpose. It descends from CLUSTER, has no additional attributes, and no descendants. Should be removed.

EntryElement:	DosageInstruction

Description:	"Supplemental instruction - e.g. 'with meals'"
Value:			CodedText

Element:		PatientInstruction
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Supplemental instruction - e.g. 'with meals'"
Value:			TEXT
// BALLOT: DosageInstruction.AdditionalInstructions and DosageInstruction.PatientInstruction have exactly the same definition ("Supplemental instruction - e.g. 'with meals'"). Certainly, the two definitions should not be identical. Additionally, the former is type CodedText, the latter is TEXT. Is there a reason for that?

Element:		AsNeeded
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Take 'as needed' (for x)"
Value:			CodedText

Element:		DoseRange
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Amount of medication per dose"
Value:			QuantitativeReferenceRange
// BALLOT: DoseRange.DosageInstruction datatype should be IntervalValue<Quantity>. Defining the attribute as a QuantitativeReferenceRange, which is of type IntervalValue<Quantity>, has little added value, and just adds a level of unneeded complexity and indirection. (For comparison, look at DoseRange.RateRange -- it is a simple IntervalValue, no need for a "middleman" class.)

Description:	"Amount of medication per unit of time"
Value:			IntervalValue

Element:		MaxDosePerPeriod
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Upper limit on medication per unit of time"

Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Medication substitution instructions - primarily whether substitutions are allowed."
0..1			WasSubstituted
0..1			Type
0..1			ResponsibleParty

// BALLOT:  SubstitutionInstruction.WasSubstituted should be eliminated. There is another class, SubstitutionInformation, to record whether a substitution was actually made. The instruction is just a directive, not a record of how the instruction was followed. 

Element:		PharmacyOrderCategory
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"This optional property is used to group related medication orders. It is included for compatibility with HL7 version 2. 'Defines the general category of pharmacy order which may be used to determine the processing path the order will take....

Value:			CodedText


Element:		PharmacyPromise	
Based on:		Promise
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"This class represents the prescription context from the perspective of the filling system (i.e., the pharmacy) whereas the Pharmacy Request represents the prescription from the ordering system (i.e., the prescriber). This class is a subtype of the more general Healthcare Promise, which describes properties common to all types or Orders from the filling system perspective– this class adds those properties which are specific to medication orders. This class is called Pharmacy Promise rather than Pharmacy Order following the HL7 V3 convention to use the term Promise to indicate that it is from the filling system’s perspective. There are many properties which are identical to the Order; this is because the pharmacy may change the order, within prescribed limits, for example substituting a generic drug for a brand-named one."
