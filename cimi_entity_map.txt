AnatomicalLocation maps to BodySite:
	Identifier maps to identifier
	//Description maps to description
	Image maps to image
	BodySite maps to code
	//Laterality
	//AnatomicalDirection
// BALLOT: AnatomicalLocation.Description cannot be mapped to BodySite.description because the former is 0..* and the latter is 0..1.

Substance maps to Substance:
	Identifier maps to identifier
	//Status maps to status
	Category maps to category
	SubstanceCode maps to code
	//Description maps to description
	Instance.Value.Identifier maps to instance.identifier
	Instance.Value.Expiry maps to instance.expiry
	Instance.Value.Quantity maps to instance.quantity
	//Ingredient.Amount maps to ingredient.quantity
	Ingredient.ItemCode maps to ingredient.substance[x].CodeableConcept
	Ingredient.Substance maps to ingredient.substance[x].Reference
// BALLOT: CIMI Substance.Description cannot be mapped to FHIR Substance.description because the former is 0..* and the latter is 0..1.
// BALLOT: Infeasible mapping from Substance.Status (CodedText) to FHIR Substance.status (code)
// BALLOT: Infeasible mapping from Substance.Ingredient.Amount (Quantity) to FHIR Substance.ingredient.quantity (Ratio)

// BALLOT: It is a problem that CIMI doesn't have a mapping to Specimen.collection.collector. I think it would come from the Performance context applied to SpecimenCollection but without making an explicit ClinicalStatement (e.g. SpecimenCollectionPerformance), it is difficult to see where the collector would come from, or how such a mapping would work.
