Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.clinical.commondatastructures
Description:	"The Common Data Structure Package holds a number of data structures used by other classes in the model."
Uses:			cimi.datatypes, cimi.foundation, cimi.clinical.provenance

Element:		Annotation
Based on:		CLUSTER
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Text node with optional attribution"
1..1			Content
0..1			Authored

Element:		Authored
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Provenance information specific to the assertion being made (e.g., the author(s), when authored, the location where the assertion was made, etc...)."
Value:			Attribution

Element:		Content
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The annotation's text content."
Value:			TEXT
// BALLOT: Annotation.Content should be type PlainText, not TEXT. Putting a code (CodedText) here would not be consistent with the intent of Annotation.

Element:		Age
Based on:		CLUSTER
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Type for the capture of age-related information."
Value:			Duration
0..1			AgeGroup
// BALLOT:	Age requires a numerical age, but it would be useful to be able to specify Age only as an AgeGroup, without a numerical age. For example, in KnownOrSuspectedPresence context, AgeAtOnset could then be "child" or "adolescent", without requiring more specificity. I think this is frequently useful, especially in terms of patient history.

Element:		AgeGroup
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Classification of age - e.g., neonatal, infant, pre-adolescent, etc..."
Value:			CodedText
