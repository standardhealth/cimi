// BALLOT: Regarding adverse reaction, and adverse event reporting, the key thing to know is that an adverse reaction is an adverse event with a causal relationship to an intervention. It should be a subclass of AdverseEvent. If you compare the two classes, AdverseReaction has everything that AdverseEvent has plus 0..* AdverseReactionAttribution, ActionTakenWithMedication, and OtherActionTaken.
