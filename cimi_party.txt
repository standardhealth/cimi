// BALLOT: HealthCareConsumerRole contains some questionable attributes. (1) Diet is a valid item in a Plan of Care (including when the patient is receives food as an inpatient), but just because a party assumes a HealthCareConsumerRole, doesn't mean that their diet immediately comes into play. (2) OrganDonorType is associated with a person, not the HealthCareConsumerRole. This class confuses information needed in a specific workflow or use case context (ADT?), with information instrinsically associated with the healthcare consumer role. 

Element:		Importance
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Importance associated with the given role such as VIP, etc..."
Value:			TEXT

Element:		PaperRecord
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"NEED DEFINITION."
Value:			TEXT

Element:		OrganDonorType

Value:			TEXT

Element:		HealthCareProvider
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The health care provider associated with this role such as the primary provider for a patient."
Value:			HealthCareProviderRelationship
// BALLOT: HealthCareConsumerRole.HealthCareProvider (datatype HealthCareProviderRelationship) is self-inconsistent. Either it is a Provider or it is a Relationship, but it can't be both. Since we link roles with relationships, it should a relationship. Same comment applies to HealthCareConsumerRole.NextOfKin. For comparison, see HealthCareProviderRole.OrganizationRelationship

Element:		NextOfKin
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The next of kin for the health care consumer."
Value:			NextOfKinRelationship

Element:		PreferredContactMethod
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Preferred contact methods."
Value:			CodedText
		
Element:		PreferredContactTime
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Preferred time to contact entity acting in this role."
Value:			DateTimeRange
// BALLOT: HealthCareConsumerRole.PreferredContactTime should not be an Inter_Value<Date_Time>. It should be a time of day, i.e., Interval_Value<Time>. Additionally, consider changing the cardinality to 0..*, not 0..1, since someone might want to be reached at various times of day, e.g., either before work, during lunch, or after work.
