Description:	"Package for classes that pertain to Adverse Event Reporting (green in diagram).

CIMI currently defines two types of adverse event reporting entries:

The first type focuses on an activity that represents a undesirable deviation from an accepted workflow and any adverse outcome(s) that may result from the breach. An example may consist of an administration of a wrong medication and an associated adverse reaction.
The second type of adverse event represents an unusual or untoward finding that is recorded. A special case pertains to adverse findings documented in the course of a clinical trial, where causality associated with the study intervention is not assumed.
The WorkflowBreach cluster is a reusable structure that may be shared across reports."
