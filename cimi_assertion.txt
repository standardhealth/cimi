Grammar:		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.clinicalassertion
Description:	"The CIMI Assertion pattern is used for assertions made about an individual's state. Typically, assertions are used to assert that the patient is a member of a 'cohort' of patient sharing a common characteristic such as asserting that a patient has diabetes or brown hair color. In an assertion, the key specifies that the statement's topic is an assertion-style statement while the name contains the concept or post-coordinated expression being asserted. Assertions do not imply necessarily that clinical judgement was used to derive the assertion though this is often the case (e.g., a formal diagnosis after a review of the evidence. Rather, the Assertion pattern is merely a structural pattern for finding statements that are not in the form of a question-answer pair (e.g., Systolic Blood Pressure = 120 mmHg). For the latter pattern, consider using the EvaluationResult pattern."

// BALLOT: Minor comment: The definition of Assertion ("Clinical Assertions assert the existence of clinical conditions, diseases, symptoms, etc. in the patient.") should be broadened, because assertions could also be about the environment of the patient, the progress of a healing process, even the absence of a symptom, etc. 

Element:		DueTo
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"This attribute is used to relate a |Clinical finding| directly to its cause. If a clinical finding merely predisposes to or worsens another disorder, rather than causing it directly, then the more general attribute | ASSOCIATED WITH | is used instead."
Value:			ref(LOCATABLE)

Element:		DueToCode
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The cause of the Clinical finding. This includes such causes as disease vectors and endogenous states (e.g., macular degeneration due to diabetes). Exogenous substances and forces should be captured as causative agent."
Value:			CodedText

Element:		Severity
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Intensity of a symptom or condition. The criteria for this value differ by condition."
Value:			CodedText

Element:		ClinicalCourse
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Both the course and onset of a disease. Many conditions with an acute (sudden) onset also have an acute (short duration) course. Few diseases with a chronic (long - term) course would need to have their onset sub-divided into rapid or gradual subtypes, and thus there is no clear need for separating the rapidity of onset from the duration of a disease; based on testing by implementers and modelers, a single attribute with values that combine these meanings has clearly been more reproducible and useful than two attributes that attempt to separate the meanings."
Value:			CodedText

Element:		Episodicity
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"TO DISCUSS: Do we need this? (STAN) |EPISODICITY| is used to represent episodes of care provided by a physician or other care provider, typically a general practitioner, not episodes of disease experienced by the patient. See EPISODICITY no longer modeled in active content (7.1), regarding the origin of the attribute. For example, asthma with |EPISODICITY|=| first episode | represents the first time the patient presents to their health care provider with asthma. EPISODICITY is not used to model any concepts pre-coordinated in the International Release but it can still be used in post-coordination as a qualifier."
Value:			CodedText

Value:			CodedText
	
Element:		AlleviatingFactor
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"An action or intervention which makes a symptom less severe. Examples of data from the value set may include: rest, heat, ice, etc. [TO ADDRESS: we may need a semantic scope: are these substances or procedures? Procedures, with the assumption that if you put in a substance it means “application (procedure)”?"
Value:			CodedText
		
Element:		ExacerbatingFactor

Description:	"whether tunneling is present"
0..1			Direction //from http://example.com/valueset/tunneling_direction_range_vs.v0.0.1
0..1			Length
// BALLOT: The definition of Tunneling ("whether tunneling is present") might be improved as follows: "Describes a discharging blind-ended track that extends from the surface of an organ to an underlying area or abscess cavity."
// BALLOT: Tunneling and Undermining both use clock direction, but to do so, they define separate value sets. Clock direction is a common way to describe anatomical location and it would be useful to have a reusable data element, so every time anyone uses clock direction, it is the exactly the same.

Element:		Odor
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The odor of the exudate"
Value:			CodedText //from http://example.com/valueset/wound_exudate_odor_range_vs.v0.0.1
// BALLOT: Odor should be defined independent of the containing class (in this case WoundExudate). This would have the effect of creating a reusable extension for odor. The specific value set could be bound to the element when it appears in the context of a wound.

Element:		VisibleInternalStructure
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Internal structure that is visible outside the body."
Value:			CodedText
// BALLOT: The datatype of VisibleInternalStructure should be (tbd) AnatomicStructure, not CodedText. CIMI has AnatomicLocation but not AnatomicStructure. This seems inconsistent.

0..1			Area
0..1			Circumference
0..1			Volume

// BALLOT: Definition of DimensionalFeatures doesn't seem accurate. It is specifically about measuring the size of something, not "Feature's physical attributes"
// BALLOT: DimensionalFeature should not be in the Assertion module. It fits better into CommonDataStructures.

Element:		Area
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The area of the feature. For instance, the area of a wound."

0..1			SensoryPerception
0..1			PhysicalActivity
0..1			PhysicalMobility
0..1			NutritionIntakePattern
0..1			FrictionAndShear
0..1			TotalScore
0..1			RiskLevel
// BALLOT: Braden Assessment: RiskAssertion is more appropriate parent class than BaseAssertion. But I believe BradenAssessment to be an EvaluationResult, and not an Assertion. The Assertion would be "Patient is at high risk of skin breakdown" and the BradenAssessment could be offered as evidence for that assertion (and perhaps other factors). The Braden Assessment itself is an Procedure, which yields the EvalutionResult (it could be that the subscores are also EvaluationResults, although here they are presented as simple attributes). It worries me a great deal that we (the core team) don't agree on "what's what", Style Guide not withstanding. I have heard the arguments that the two are simply "styles" and they are isosemantic forms. I don't think that is true in this case. Braden is like a lab test or any other observation, actually, closer to a panel. The conclusions drawn from information constitutes the assertion.

// BALLOT: BradenAssessment seems like it would be a CompoundClincalStatement (Panel). But the parent is BaseAssertion, which descends from StatementTopic and CLUSTER. What is the reasoning for this? If Braden isn't a Panel, then what is?
