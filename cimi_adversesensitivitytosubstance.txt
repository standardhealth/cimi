Description:	"Package for classes that pertain to Allergies and Intolerances (green in diagram). The AdverseSensitivityToSubstance is a CIMI class used to represent an allergy or intolerance to a substance. Note that it differs from an adverse reaction to a substance in that a patient may have an allergy to peanuts that may only manifest itself when exposed to peanuts or peanut-related products. If exposed, the resulting reaction is modeled using the AdverseReaction class. The predisposition for such adverse reactions when exposure to the substance occurs is captured by AdverseSensitivityToSubstance."
