// Assertion is a finding topic, not a complete clinical statement. Some elements have to come from 

Assertion maps to Condition:
	//ArchetypeNodeId
	//Name
	//ArchetypeDetails
	//Key
	//Result
	constrain note to 0..1  // To match cardinality of Description
	Description.Value maps to note.text // Did not map to text.div because text.div is type xhtml
	// Multimedia maps to evidence.detail 
	DateAsserted maps to assertedDate
	//VerificationStatus maps to verificationStatus
	//FindingMethod
	//ClinicalStatus maps to clinicalStatus
	//DueTo
	//DueToCode
	Severity maps to severity
	//ClinicalCourse
	//Episodicity
	DiseasePhase maps to stage.summary
	//AssociatedPrecondition
	//AssociatedSignAndSymptom
	//Periodicity
	//AlleviatingFactor
	//ExacerbatingFactor
	//CausativeAgent
	//CausativeAgentCode

// BALLOT: Infeasible datatype mapping from Assertion.ClinicalStatus to FHIR Condition.clinicalStatus (CodedText to code)
// BALLOT: Infeasible datatype mapping from Assertion.VerificationStatus to FHIR Condition.verificationStatus (CodedText to code)
// BALLOT: In mapping Assertion to FHIR Condition, a relevant multimedia image (inherited from FindingTopic.Multimedia) should be included in evidence.detail. However, Multimedia is a datatype, and as such, it can't be mapped to evidence.detail because the latter requires a reference to a resource (Reference(Any)).
// BALLOT: Assertion.Description.Value mapping to Condition.note.text isn't a great fit because the notes are supposed to be an annotations, later updates. I think it would be more appropriate to map Description.Value to the narrative that accompanies every DomainResource (text.div), but that is datatype xhtml, and string can't be mapped to xhtml.
