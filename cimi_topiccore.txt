Grammar: 		DataElement 5.0
Namespace:		cimi.clinicaltopiccore
Description:	"The Topic Core package contains the top-level specializations of the Statement Topic class, namely, the FindingTopic, ActionTopic, and EventTopic classes."
Uses:			cimi.datatypes, cimi.foundation

Element:		StatementTopic
Based on:		VIRTUALCLUSTER
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Compositional and reusable grouping of clinical statement attributes that make up the clinical focus of the statement. StatementTopic class attributes are aligned with SNOMED CT Concept Model attributes when such an overlap exists. Note that this class does not include contextual attributes such as the nature of the action (ordered, proposed, planned, etc...), the nature of the patient state being described (e.g., present, suspected present, absent), and the provenance of this information (the who, when, where, how, why of the information recorded)."
1..1			Key

Element:		Key
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The concept representing the finding&#47;event being observed or the action being described. The code attribute's semantics is aligned to either associatedFinding or associatedProcedure in the SNOMED CT Situation with Explicit Context Concept Model. For findings, the key contains a concept for an observable entity. For assertions, the key contains a concept specifying that an assertion is made. For acts, the key contains a concept specifying the procedure described."
Value:			CodedText

Element:		EventTopic

0..1			Result
0..1			Description  //TODO: This should be 0..1, but doing so generates an CLI error
0..*			Multimedia

Element:		Result
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"The unqualified value of the evaluation or assertion."
Value:			DATAVALUE

Element:		Description
Concept:		TBD
Description:	"Description of the finding."
Value:			PlainText
// BALLOT: Description is the type of attribute that could be reused many times over. To facilitate that, it should be defined in a generic way. FindingTopic.Description defines description specifically in reference to a finding, which limits potential reuse of the element.

Element:		ProcedureTopic
Based on:		StatementTopic
Concept:		TBD
